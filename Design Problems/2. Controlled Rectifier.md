# 🔁 SCR-Controlled Full-Bridge Rectifier — Design Problem & Solution

---

## 🧩 1. Problem Statement (Design Requirements)

Design a **single-phase full-controlled bridge rectifier** (4 SCRs) feeding a **large-inductance load** (continuous DC current). The system must deliver:

* AC mains: **230 V RMS**, 50 Hz (primary).
* Required average DC output: **(V_{DC,\text{nom}} = 100\ \text{V})** at **firing angle (\alpha = 30^\circ)**.
* DC load current: **(I_{DC} = 5.0\ \text{A})** (assumed continuous because of large inductance).
* Load: highly inductive (current continuous), so output current ripple ≈ 0.
* Deliverables: transformer secondary selection, SCR ratings (voltage/current/surge), transformer & VA rating, snubber and gate considerations, and thumb rules.

> Note: For continuous-current operation of a full-controlled bridge, average output voltage:
> [
> V_{DC} = \frac{2V_m}{\pi}\cos\alpha
> ]
> where (V_m) is the secondary peak voltage.

---

## 🧠 2. Assumptions & Design Approach

* Full-controlled bridge (four SCRs) with large load inductance ⇒ **current continuous**.
* Neglect commutation overlap (ideal commutation) for first-order design (mention when overlap matters).
* SCR forward drop small compared to (V_m) (will include modest margin).
* Add ≈ 5–10% transformer voltage margin for regulation.
* Use standard part ratings (600–1000 V SCRs common).

---

## 🧮 3. Key formulas used (summary)

* Secondary peak: (V_m = V_{s,\text{rms}}\sqrt{2})
* Controlled full-bridge (continuous current):
  [
  V_{DC} = \frac{2V_m}{\pi}\cos\alpha
  ]
* Output power: (P_{DC} = V_{DC},I_{DC})
* Transformer apparent power (approx): (S_{sec}\approx V_{s,\text{rms}} \cdot I_{s,\text{rms}})
* SCR average on-state loss approx: (P_{SCR}\approx V_{T}\cdot I_{DC}) (where (V_T) is voltage drop ≈ 1–2 V)
* Snubber RC time constant: ( \tau = R_s C_s ) chosen to limit dv/dt.

## 🔢 4. Calculate required transformer secondary voltage

Given:
[
V_{DC} = \frac{2V_m}{\pi}\cos\alpha
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
V_m = \frac{\pi,V_{DC}}{2\cos\alpha}.
]

Plug numbers: (V_{DC}=100\ \text{V},\ \alpha=30^\circ,\ \cos\alpha=0.8660).

[
V_m = \frac{\pi \times 100}{2 \times 0.8660}
= \frac{314.159}{1.732}
\approx 181.4\ \text{V}.
]

Secondary RMS:
[
V_{s,\text{rms}} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{181.4}{1.4142} \approx 128.3\ \text{V}.
]

✅ **Select standard secondary:** **130 V RMS** (common close value).
Thus:
[
V_{s,peak} = V_m \approx 181.4\ \text{V}.
]

(If you prefer 115 V secondary like previous example, you cannot reach 100 V DC at α=30° — so secondary was increased.)

---

## ⚡ 5. Output & power check

Average DC output at α = 30° (re-compute with selected secondary peak):
[
V_{DC,\text{actual}}=\frac{2V_m}{\pi}\cos\alpha
= \frac{2\times181.4}{\pi}\times 0.866 = 99.98\ \text{V} \approx 100\ \text{V}.
]

Output power:
[
P_{DC} = V_{DC} , I_{DC} = 100 \times 5 = 500\ \text{W}.
]

---

## 🔋 6. Transformer current & VA rating

For continuous current (full-controlled), secondary current waveform ≈ nearly dc (but contains low order harmonics). As a practical design rule use a small multiplier to account for waveform distortion.

**Thumb rule (continuous current):** (I_{s,\text{rms}} \approx 1.0 \times I_{DC}) (approx). Use margin factor 1.1.

[
I_{s,\text{rms}} \approx 1.1 \times 5 = 5.5\ \text{A}.
]

Transformer secondary VA:
[
S_{sec} \approx V_{s,\text{rms}} \cdot I_{s,\text{rms}} = 130 \times 5.5 = 715\ \text{VA}.
]

✅ **Choose transformer:** **230 V : 130 V, 6 A (or 7 A) secondary**, rated ≈ **800 VA** to be safe.

**Thumb rules – transformer**

* Continuous current rectifier: use **I_sec ≈ 1.0–1.2 × I_DC**.
* Add **10–20% VA margin** for heating and regulation.

---

## 🧭 7. SCR selection (voltage & current ratings)

### (a) Voltage rating (V_RRM)

* Peak reverse (off-state) voltage an SCR must withstand ≈ (V_{s,peak}).
* Add safety margin → choose VRRM ≥ **2–3×** expected peak for transients.

Here:
[
V_{s,peak} \approx 181.4\ \text{V} \Rightarrow \text{choose } VRRM \ge 600\ \text{V (typical)}
]

### (b) Current rating

* DC load current 5 A continuous → choose SCR with (I_{T(AV)} \ge 2\times I_{DC}) for safety & cooling → **≥ 10 A**.
* Peak surge (non-repetitive) IFSM ≥ 100–200 A (for mains half-cycle).

### (c) Power dissipation

Assume SCR forward voltage (V_T \approx 1.2\ \text{V}):
[
P_{SCR,on} \approx V_T \cdot I_{DC} = 1.2 \times 5 = 6\ \text{W} \quad (\text{per conducting SCR average when ON}).
]
But in bridge each conduction period two SCRs conduct alternately — distribute losses and check heatsinking.

**Recommendation:** SCRs rated **≥ 600 V, 10–25 A** (e.g., 16 A / 600 V devices) with proper heatsink.

---

## 🔒 8. Snubber, commutation & gate drive

* **Snubber (RC)** across each SCR to limit (dv/dt) and absorb transients. Typical values for power line: (C_s = 0.01–0.1\ \mu\text{F},\ R_s) chosen so peak snubber energy safe.
* **MOV** on mains for surge protection.
* **Gate drive**: Provide isolated gate pulses with adequate gate current (few hundred mA peak for 10–50 µs) and proper timing to achieve desired α. Use opto-isolated or transformer gate drivers if required.
* **Commutation**: With large load inductance, natural commutation is okay (current continuous); with low inductance load a forced commutation or overlap modeling is required.

**Thumb rules – snubber & gate**

* Gate pulse width: **≥ 50 μs**, amplitude per SCR datasheet (e.g., 1–2 A peak gate current for short time).
* dv/dt limiting: choose snubber so (dv/dt_{allowed}) > expected mains transients.

---

## 🧱 9. Harmonics & Filtering (optional)

* Controlled rectifier injects harmonics into AC source (dominant low-order odd harmonics). For strict THD limits, add series inductance or active filtering.
* DC side already inductive (current ripple low) so additional capacitor filter not needed for this inductive load design.

---

## 🧾 10. Example component choices (practical)

* Transformer: **230 V → 130 V, 6–8 A secondary**, ~800 VA.
* SCRs (4): **TYP**: 600 V VRRM, 16 A IF(AV), IFSM ≥ 200 A (e.g., 16A/600V SCR modules).
* Gate drivers: Opto-isolated gate driver per SCR, gate resistors and snubber network per datasheet.
* MOV: rated for 275 VAC (mains) across primary; snubber RC across SCRs.
* Heat sink: designed to dissipate ~6 W per SCR with thermal resistance RθHS to keep junction < 125 °C.

## ✅ 11. Worked numeric summary (all formulas shown)

1. Solve for (V_m):
   [
   V_m = \frac{\pi V_{DC}}{2\cos\alpha} = \frac{\pi × 100}{2 × 0.8660} = 181.4\ \text{V}
   ]

2. Secondary RMS:
   [
   V_{s,\text{rms}} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{181.4}{1.4142} = 128.3\ \text{V} \Rightarrow \textbf{choose 130 V}
   ]

3. Output power:
   [
   P_{DC} = V_{DC} I_{DC} = 100 × 5 = 500\ \text{W}
   ]

4. Transformer VA (approx):
   [
   I_{s,\text{rms}} \approx 1.1 × I_{DC} = 5.5\ \text{A} \quad\Rightarrow\quad S_{sec} \approx 130 × 5.5 = 715\ \text{VA}
   ]
   → choose ~800 VA transformer.

5. SCR voltage rating:
   [
   V_{s,peak} = V_m ≈ 181.4\ \text{V} \Rightarrow VRRM ≈ 600–1000\ \text{V (use 600 V)}
   ]

6. SCR current rating:
   [
   I_{T(AV)} \ge 2×I_{DC} \approx 10\ \text{A} \quad(\text{choose 16 A for margin})
   ]

7. SCR conduction loss (approx):
   [
   P_{SCR} \approx V_T I_{DC} ≈ 1.2 × 5 = 6\ \text{W}
   ]

## 🔍 12. Practical design / lecture notes & thumb rules (short)

* **If current is continuous**: use formula (V_{DC}=\dfrac{2V_m}{\pi}\cos\alpha).
* **Choose secondary** so (V_{s,rms}=V_m/\sqrt{2}) → round to nearest standard.
* **Transformer current**: for continuous current → (I_{sec}\approx 1.0–1.2 × I_{DC}). For capacitor-input supplies use ≈1.8×.
* **SCR VRRM**: pick ≥ **600–1000 V** for mains applications even when calculated peak lower (transient margin).
* **SCR IF(AV)**: choose ≥ **2× I_DC**; IFSM ≥ **10× I_DC**.
* **Gate**: provide isolated gate drive and clean, repeatable firing pulses.
* **Snubber**: RC across each SCR to limit dv/dt; MOV on mains for surges.
* **Commutation overlap**: becomes important at high load current and when source impedance not negligible — discuss angular overlap (\mu) in advanced lectures.
