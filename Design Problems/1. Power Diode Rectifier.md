# Power-Diode Rectifier — Design Problem & Complete Solution

Understood, **HK Roni Sir**. Below I present a formal, self-contained design problem followed by a detailed step-by-step solution (assumptions, equations, numerical results, component selection, and practical notes). You can reuse this as a worked example in a lecture or lab handout.

## 1. Problem Statement (Design Requirements)

Design a single-phase **full-wave bridge rectifier** (diode bridge) with a capacitor-input filter to supply a DC load with the following specifications:

* AC mains (primary): **230 V RMS**, 50 Hz.
* Required DC output: **(V_{DC,\text{nom}} = 160\ \text{V})** (nominal average DC).
* Load current: **(I_{DC} = 5.0\ \text{A})** (constant resistive load).
* Allowed peak-to-peak ripple at DC: **≤ 5% of (V_{DC,\text{nom}})**.
* Provide suitable choices for transformer secondary rating, filter capacitor, diode ratings (voltage & current), and basic thermal considerations.

**Deliverables:** transformer secondary voltage, filter capacitor value, diode PIV and current ratings, estimated losses, and final recommended component specs.

---

## 2. Assumptions

1. Full-wave bridge rectifier (4 diodes) with **capacitor-input filter** (most common for DC supply).
2. Diode forward drop (V_D \approx 1.0\ \text{V}) at operating current (use 0.8–1.2 V as typical for power diodes).
3. Transformer regulation / voltage drop / tolerances → include a small margin (about 5% additional secondary voltage for real-world losses). I will note margin selection explicitly where used.
4. Ripple frequency (f_r = 2 \times f_\text{line} = 100\ \text{Hz}).
5. Capacitor ESR and ripple current capability will be checked qualitatively; pick a capacitor with appropriate ripple current rating.

---

## 3. Key formulas

* Peak secondary voltage: (V_{s,\text{peak}} = V_{s,\text{rms}} \sqrt{2}).
* Ideal DC average (capacitor input): (V_{DC} \approx V_{s,\text{peak}} - 2V_D).
* Capacitor ripple (approx., for small ripple): (\Delta V_{pp} \approx \dfrac{I_{DC}}{C , f_r}).
* Required capacitance: (C \approx \dfrac{I_{DC}}{f_r , \Delta V_{pp}}).
* Diode PIV (each diode in bridge): ( \text{PIV} \gtrsim V_{s,\text{peak}} ) (use safety factor).
* Average conduction / thermal: approximate diode conduction losses (P_D \approx V_D \cdot I_{DC}) (conservative estimate).

## 4. Compute transformer secondary voltage

We want (V_{DC} \approx 160\ \text{V}). Use
[
V_{DC} \approx V_{s,\text{peak}} - 2V_D = V_{s,\text{rms}}\sqrt{2} - 2V_D.
]
Solve for (V_{s,\text{rms}}).

Take (V_D = 1.0\ \text{V}) → (2V_D = 2\ \text{V}).

[
V_{s,\text{rms}} = \frac{V_{DC} + 2V_D}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{160 + 2}{1.4142} = \frac{162}{1.4142}\approx 114.6\ \text{V RMS}.
]

Choose a standard secondary: **115 V RMS** (a common standard) — good match.

Check peak:
[
V_{s,\text{peak}} = 115 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 162.6\ \text{V}.
]
Then predicted DC:
[
V_{DC} \approx 162.6 - 2\times1.0 \approx 160.6\ \text{V}
]
which meets the 160 V requirement (≈ +0.6 V). Good.

**Transformer turns/ratio:** Primary 230 V → secondary 115 V (ratio 2:1).

Allow ~5% margin for regulation if transformer loaded; if regulation causes secondary sag, consider specifying unloaded secondary slightly higher (e.g., 118 V). For lecture, 230:115 is fine.

---

## 5. Filter capacitor calculation (ripple requirement)

Ripple allowed: 5% of 160 V → (\Delta V_{pp,\max} = 0.05 \times 160 = 8.0\ \text{V}).

Ripple frequency (f_r = 100\ \text{Hz}).

Capacitance:
[
C \approx \frac{I_{DC}}{f_r ,\Delta V_{pp}} = \frac{5.0}{100 \times 8.0} = \frac{5}{800} = 0.00625\ \text{F} = 6250\ \mu\text{F}.
]

Choose a standard value with margin: **6800 µF or 8200 µF** at suitable voltage. Because DC voltage ~161 V, capacitor working voltage must be safely above that — choose **rated voltage ≥ 200 V**. So **6800 µF, 200 V electrolytic** (or 8200 µF, 200 V) is recommended.

Practical note: At high voltages, large capacitances in a single electrolytic are more expensive; consider using two series 100 V capacitors with balancing resistors if 200 V caps are not available — but then effective capacitance halves and ESR considerations change. For simplicity: use a proper 200 V electrolytic module rated for ripple current.

## 6. Diode voltage and current ratings

### 6.1 Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV)

For a bridge rectifier, each diode must withstand roughly the full secondary peak when reverse biased:

[
\text{PIV} \gtrsim V_{s,\text{peak}} \approx 162.6\ \text{V}.
]

Add margin for transients and safety: choose diode blocking voltage at least **3× safety margin** → use diodes rated **≥ 400 V** (common standard values: 200 V, 400 V, 600 V). **600 V** gives excellent margin and is widely available.

**Recommendation:** choose diodes rated **600 V repetitive peak reverse voltage** (VRRM ≥ 600 V).

### 6.2 Continuous average forward current (IF(AV))

The load DC current is 5 A. In a bridge each diode conducts in pulses; the average forward current per conducting diode equals the load current during its conduction intervals. For safety choose diodes with continuous forward current rating ≥ **5 A**.

However, because of pulse charging of the capacitor, the diodes see high peak currents (short pulses) — therefore choose diodes with **IF(AV) ≥ 10 A** or use a bridge module rated for ≥ 10 A. Common practical choices:

* Discrete diodes: **10 A, 600 V** fast or ultra-fast recovery diodes (e.g. generic 10A/600V devices).
* Bridge module: **KBPC5010** (50 A, 1000 V) is overkill for current but common; for compactness use a 10 A bridge like **KBPC1010** (10 A, 1000 V). A 10 A bridge rated 1000 V is commonly available and cheap.

### 6.3 Surge (non-repetitive) current (IFSM)

Capacitor charging pulses generate short peak currents; select diodes with adequate surge current rating (e.g., IFSM ≥ 100–200 A for 8.3 ms half-cycle standard). Many bridge modules specify IFSM in that range.

---

## 7. Diode thermal and loss estimation

Take conservative (V_D = 1.0\ \text{V}).

Conduction loss (average) per diode while conducting:
[
P_{D,\text{avg}} \approx V_D \cdot I_{DC} \approx 1.0 \times 5.0 = 5.0\ \text{W}
]
But since each diode conducts only during its conduction pulse, the average across all diodes is somewhat lower. Using 5 W per conducting diode is conservative — use a heat sink.

If you pick diodes rated IF(AV) = 10 A and mount on a small heat sink, they will cope well. For bridge modules, check datasheet for thermal resistance (RθJA) and use (T_J = T_A + P \cdot R_{\theta JA}) to verify.

---

## 8. Summary of recommended component specs (practical)

* Transformer: **Primary 230 V**, **Secondary 115 V RMS**, rated for at least **5 A DC output** plus margin for rectifier/transformer heating. Because DC output 5 A draws apparent AC RMS in the secondary higher than 5 A (due to non-sinusoidal pulses), choose transformer secondary current rating **≥ 1.8 × I_DC ≈ 9 A** as practical rule of thumb for capacitor-input supplies.

  * **Recommendation:** Transformer secondary rating **115 V, 10 A** (to keep transformer below rated temperature and allow regulation).
* Rectifier: Full-wave bridge — either 4 discrete diodes or a bridge module.

  * **Discrete**: four **10 A, 600 V** fast/ultra-fast recovery diodes (e.g., 10A/600V FR diodes).
  * **Bridge module**: **KBPC1010** (10 A, 1000 V) or similar (many modules available).
* Filter capacitor: **8200 µF, 200 V electrolytic** (or 6800 µF 200 V). Ensure ripple current rating ≥ expected ripple current (datasheet).
* Output smoothing / bleed resistor: small bleed resistor across the capacitor to discharge safely (e.g., 100 kΩ / 200 V rated if required for safety).
* Fusing: Primary fuse rated appropriately (fast blow on primary ~maybe 1–2 A depending on transformer), secondary fuse or DC-side fuse for protection (e.g., 6–8 A slow-blow).
* Snubber / MOV: For surge protection across diodes/transformer consider an MOV or transient suppression device on the mains side.
* Heatsinking: Mount diodes or bridge module on a heatsink; check datasheet thermal specs.

**Why the transformer current was chosen larger than 5 A:** capacitor-input rectifiers draw current pulses near voltage peaks, creating higher RMS current in the transformer secondary. A 10 A rated secondary will run cooler and provide better regulation (and avoids overheating).

## 9. Verification — compute expected ripple with chosen parts

Take chosen capacitor (C = 8200\ \mu\text{F} = 8.2 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{F}).

[
\Delta V_{pp} \approx \frac{I_{DC}}{f_r C} = \frac{5}{100 \times 8.2\times 10^{-3}} = \frac{5}{0.82} \approx 6.10\ \text{V}_{pp}.
]
Ripple as percent: (6.10/160 \times 100% \approx 3.8%) → **within the 5% spec**.

DC average is about 160.6 V as shown earlier. Good.

---

## 10. Additional practical considerations (lecture points)

1. **Transformer regulation**: Under load the secondary may drop (voltage regulation), so the unloaded secondary should be slightly higher or specify the transformer regulation. For critical loads, include a voltage regulator stage (DC–DC converter or linear regulator) after the filter.
2. **Diode recovery**: If switching transients are significant, prefer **fast recovery** or **Schottky** diodes (for lower Vf and faster switching). At 160 V DC and 5 A, power Schottky with suitable reverse voltage may be expensive; fast recovery 10 A / 600–1000 V diodes are common.
3. **Ripple current rating of capacitor**: ensure the electrolytic has adequate ripple current rating at 100 Hz. Use low ESR caps to reduce heating.
4. **EMI / input inductance**: Large charging pulses can create EMI; a small series inrush limiting resistor or NTC can protect transformer and diodes on startup.
5. **Safety margins**: Choose VRRM significantly higher than calculated PIV (we used 600–1000 V parts as common industry choices).
6. **Thermal design**: compute junction temp using datasheet thermal resistance and expected power dissipation; use heatsink if needed.
7. **Inrush current**: On first power-up the capacitor is uncharged and diodes see large charging currents. Use soft-start or inrush limiting to protect diodes and transformer.

## 11. Final recommended parts (example)

* Transformer: **230 V primary — 115 V secondary, 10 A, 50 Hz**, toroidal or EI core, with ~3–5% regulation.
* Bridge: **KBPC1010** (10 A, 1000 V) bridge module — common, inexpensive, good surge rating. Or 4 × **10 A, 600 V Fast recovery diodes** (e.g., 10A/600V FR).
* Filter capacitor: **8200 µF, 200 V electrolytic**, low-ESR, ripple current rating ≥ 2 A (check datasheet).
* Output fuse: 6–8 A slow blow on DC side; primary fuse per transformer spec.
* Heatsink: small aluminium heatsink for bridge or diodes; thermal paste and mounting hardware.

## 12. Compact Worked Summary (numbers)

* Secondary (V_{s,\text{rms}} = 115\ \text{V}).
* (V_{s,\text{peak}} \approx 162.6\ \text{V}).
* (V_{DC} \approx 160.6\ \text{V}) (after 2 diode drops).
* Required (C \approx 6250\ \mu\text{F}); choose **8200 µF @ 200 V** → ripple ≈ **6.1 Vpp (3.8%)**.
* Diode PIV: choose **≥ 400 V**, recommended **600 V** or **1000 V** bridge (for margin).
* Diode average current: choose **IF(AV) ≥ 10 A** devices / bridge; surge rating adequate (IFSM ≥ 100 A).
* Transformer secondary current rating recommendation: **10 A** (due to pulsed currents).

## 13. Short checklist for implementing this design

1. Order transformer 230:115 V, 10 A.
2. Order bridge module (KBPC1010) or discrete diodes (4 × 10A/600V FR), heatsink.
3. Order 8200 µF, 200 V electrolytic cap (low ESR), bleed resistor, fuses.
4. Assemble on PCB, include snubber or MOV across primary for surge suppression.
5. Measure no-load & full-load DC output, check ripple with oscilloscope, measure diode and transformer temperatures under full load.
6. If ripple or heat is too high, increase capacitance, upgrade diodes, or add regulator.
