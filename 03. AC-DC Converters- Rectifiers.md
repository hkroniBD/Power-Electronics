#### **Operation Analysis:**

**For resistive load (R):**

During positive half-cycle (0 ≤ ωt ≤ π):
```
vo(t) = vm sin(ωt)
io(t) = (vm/R) sin(ωt)
```

During negative half-cycle (π ≤ ωt ≤ 2π):
```
vo(t) = 0
io(t) = 0
```

#### **Performance Parameters:**

**Average Output Voltage:**
```
Vdc = (1/2π) ∫[0 to π] vm sin(ωt) d(ωt) = vm/π = 0.318 vm
```

**Average Output Current:**
```
Idc = Vdc/R = vm/(πR)
```

**RMS Output Voltage:**
```
Vrms = vm/2 = 0.5 vm
```

**Form Factor:**
```
FF = Vrms/Vdc = (vm/2)/(vm/π) = π/2 = 1.57
```

**Ripple Factor:**
```
RF = √(FF² - 1) = √((π/2)² - 1) = 1.21
```

## 4. Rectifiers with Inductive Loads

### 4.1 Effect of Load Inductance

When the load has inductance, the current cannot change instantaneously, leading to:

```
Lcrit = R/(2πf)
```

### 4.3 Three-Phase Bridge with Inductive Load

#### **Continuous Current Operation:**
- For highly inductive loads, current is essentially constant
- Each diode conducts for exactly 120°
- Output voltage follows upper envelope of phase voltages

#### **Performance with Continuous Current:**
```
Vdc = (3√3)/π × VL = 1.35 VL (for line voltage VL)
Idc = Vdc/R (for resistive component)
```

Transformer ratio: n = V1/V2 = 220/53.3 = 4.13:1
```

#### **Step 3: Diode Selection**
```
Average current per diode: ID(avg) = Idc/2 = 10A
