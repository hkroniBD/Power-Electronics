### How to Select a Component:

1.  **Voltage Rating:** Always choose a voltage rating with a significant safety margin (e.g., 1.5x - 2x the expected maximum voltage).
2.  **Current Rating:** Consider both continuous current and peak surge currents. Heatsinking is crucial.
3.  **Switching Speed:** MOSFETs for high frequency (>100kHz), IGBTs for lower frequency/higher power.
4.  **Package:** Through-hole (TO-220, TO-247) for prototyping and heatsinking. Surface-mount (DFN, D2PAK) for compact, automated production.
5.  **Application:** Match the component's strengths to the application (e.g., a Schottky diode for a 100kHz SMPS output, not a standard recovery diode).

For specific projects, always consult the **datasheet** from the manufacturer. It contains all the critical information needed for a safe and reliable design.
