### **1. Introduction**

Welcome, everyone. Today's lecture will focus on the essential building blocks of any power electronic system: the components and devices. Understanding these components—their capabilities, limitations, and applications—is the first step toward designing efficient converters, inverters, and motor drives.

Power electronics is the art of converting and controlling electrical power using semiconductor devices operating in switching mode. Unlike analog electronics, where devices operate in their linear region, power electronic devices act as **switches**—either fully ON (conducting) or fully OFF (blocking). This switching operation is what allows for high efficiency, as ideally, no power is dissipated in the switch in either state.

We will categorize these components into five groups:
1.  Discrete Switching Devices
2.  Gate Drive & Control ICs
3.  Modules & Integrated Power Stages
4.  Passive Components
5.  Sensors & Protection

### **2. Discrete Switching Devices**

These are the fundamental semiconductor switches that handle the main power flow. Your choice of switch depends entirely on the voltage, current, and switching frequency requirements of your application.
